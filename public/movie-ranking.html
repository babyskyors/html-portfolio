<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>

<p>This movie makes you feel a thousand emotions. It would make you realize that all kinds of people deserve redemption one way or another.</p>

<h3>So Close</h3>

<p>This action-packed movie is a childhood core memory of mine. I guess what really mattered to me isn't the actual watching of this movie but the memory of having watched this together with my siblings when we were young, which doesn't happen very often anymore these days now that we're all adults.</p>

<h3>Soul</h3>

<p>This Pixar movie hits right in the fucking feels. You begin with a light-hearted child friendly movie and end up with the feeling of existencial crisis. I legitemately rethinked my life decisions after watching this movie.</p>
